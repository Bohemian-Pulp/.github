## About Bohemian Pulp
Bohemian Pulp was founded by **Djordje** and **Jasmina Markovic** as their passion project boosted by **Djordje’s** idea of a short point-and-click detective game that slowly evolved into a full-scale game with innovative twists on the genre.

**Let Bions Be Bygones** is the studio’s first and only game, but our goal is to continue making games with a philosophy around strong narratives and a great atmosphere.
Currently, there are five key people in Bohemian Pulp, and a few more contributing on the side. Most of them are working as passionate contributors, contractors, or part-time.
